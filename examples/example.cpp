// Start by reporting 1 as it always divides evenly.  Then check the
// numbers from 2 to 1/2 of number and report each that divide evenly.
// No value greater than 1/2 of number (except for the number itself)
// could divide evenly.  Then end by reporting the number itself.

// could have used the modulus operator but I wanted an example of
// nested loops.
